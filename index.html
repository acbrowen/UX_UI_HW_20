        <p class="lead">a usability makeover for a nonprofit's website</p>
        <p>In the course of our UX/UI bootcamp, my team and I undertook a challenge to redesign a website for a nonprofit organization. We chose to work with LGBT+ Outdoors, an organization formed to promote participation in outdoor activities for the queer community, a space which many community members have experienced as unwelcoming, hostile, or dangerous.
            To better understand how to serve our users, we focused on how to improve the site's usability, specifically serving the goal of increasing participation in local chapter activities.</p>

We’ve observed that their website isn’t optimized for communicating necessary information and resources. This prevents potential participants from partaking in trips, clinics, and workshops that would allow for safe, queer-positive community building.</p>
              <p>How might we improve the LGBT+ Outdoors website so that we draw in members of the queer community and ensure they have a more inclusive and immersive outdoor experience within nature?</p>
